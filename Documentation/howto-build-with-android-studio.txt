Building with Android Studio is quite easy. Just follow these steps:

    0. Git with LFS is required, for instance included with Git for Windows since 2.12
       Do not forget to run "git lfs install" after installation.

    1. Run the following command to get all submodules:
    
        git submodule init && git submodule update
        
    2. Download Android studio here:
    
        http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html
        
    3. When Android Studio is started, choose import project and pick the build.gradle file inside the runnerup folder.
    
    4. If Android Studio asks about what gradle to use, choose "gradle wrapper".
    
    5. Let Android Studio sync the project
    
    6. Press on the play button and the project should compile and deploy to your device!
